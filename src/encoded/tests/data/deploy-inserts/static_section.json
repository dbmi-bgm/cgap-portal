        "body": "## Annotation Browser\n\nThe portal features a built-in annotation brower that visualizes the reference sequence, gene transcripts, entries in the ClinVar database, orthologous amino acids and gnomAD allele frequencies around a location of interest (an identified variant). It is based on [HiGlass](https://higlass.io) and allows genome-wide zooming and panning.\n\nThe example below shows a 60bp window around the location chr9:110,697,334.\n\n![annotation-browser-zoomed-in](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53857412/105904276-ee4fe280-5fee-11eb-9ba3-d14d15354e19.png)\n\nA zoomed-out view spanning three exons of this gene is shown below. The striped, vertical line indicates the original location of interest.\n\n![annotation-browser-zoomed-in png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53857412/105895866-138b2380-5fe4-11eb-9be1-227961b92f28.png)\n\nAs shown in the example above, the annotation browser has a top and a bottom view. Both views can be individually panned and zoomed. The top view is a gene annotation track which serves as an overview and shows where in the gene the variant is located. It can also be used to quickly look at neighboring genes. The gray rectangle indicates the extent of the detailed bottom view. The rectangle itself can be panned and resized, which is a convenient way of changing the location and extent of the bottom view.\n\nThe bottom view shows several tracks that can assist with the interpretation of variants:\n\n- The sequence track shows the reference sequence (hg38). The nucleotides are only visible when sufficiently zoomed in.\n- The transcripts track shows gene transcripts (exons, introns, UTRs) as defined in the GENCODE gene set. When sufficiently zoomed in, the transcribed amino acids are displayed. Hovering over the amino acids shows information about some of its properties.\n- The ClinVar track show variants reported in the ClinVar database, together with their clinical significance. Hovering over the data points displays the location, type and ClinVar review status of the variant.\n- The orthologous amino acids track shows how conserved a location is accross species. When sufficiently zoomed in, the track displays the protein sequence of each species. Grayed out letters indicate that there is a mismatch between the human and the species sequence. Grayed out dashes show a deletion in the species sequence, orange bars indicate an insertion (hovering over these bars shows the inserted sequence). The data for this track comes from Ensembl. In the case that Ensembl does not contain data for a particluar gene and species, the corresponding row will be gray.\n- The gnomAD track displays allele frequencies of variants observed in the gnomAD database on a logarithmic scale. Hovering over the variants displays additional information (type, location, allele count, allele frequency, allele number). This track only shows variants that passed the variant quality filters applied by gnomAD.\n\n\n\n## BAM file viewer\n\nThe portal includes an efficient, interactive BAM file viewer based on HiGlass. \n\n![bam-file-viewer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53857412/106038633-2fef9480-60a6-11eb-8383-75409f4fa32e.png)\n\nAs in the Annotation Browser, the display contains a gene annotation track that serves as an overview of where we are in genome. The bottom view shows the reference sequence and canonical transcripts at the location of interest. BAM files of multiple family members can be browsed at once. Hovering over reads or the coverage track of a BAM file displays additional information. The color scheme of the BAM file tracks correspond to the color scheme of the reference sequence, so that the variants can be easily classified. The BAM file viewer displays variants, insertions, deletions and soft/hard clipped reads.",

The chart below summarizes different data containers and their relations to each other.\n\n![CGAP Cohort Metadata Structure](https://i.imgur.com/kGGQI1P.png)\n\n### Uploading a new Cohort\nTo upload a new cohort, go to cgap home page, login, and click 'New Cohort' button.\n\nThis will take you to the cohort submssion user interface, and ask for title, project and institution.\n\n#### Adding family information\nWe are currently using Proband App to collect family history. Data from the app can be exported as pbxml file, which can be uploaded under a cohort. This will generate all the individuals, their relations, and also the phenotypic feature.\n\nPlease follow the Proband SOP for generating pbxml files that are compatible with our system.\n\n##### Protocol for using Proband App\n\nAncestry:\nPut that information per individual at the top level ( not only for generation I). If know for g.father, \nAnd g. Mother separately, put that info separately, if not, put the same information on both.\nSimple logic, if there is ancestry, show it\n\n\nAge:\nFor  each individual, we will calculate the year of birth, and to be able to do that, we will ask for a timestamp when a pbxml is submitted (date the information was acquired).\nFor pregnancy, G. age field will be used as the age with \u2018weeks\u2019 unit.\nFor death, TOP, SAB, SB, we will store cause of death (HPO term), and D. age.\n\nWhen age is not exact (is often the case with far generations)\nPut an age that is close to the range\nAnd in the notes, add that it is not exact\nGoing forward, we should have the option to have (~) sign next to the age\n\nAdding Phenotypic Features:\nProband has 4 Affected phenotypic features, which we will use as the \u201ccase (family) phenotypic features\u201d. If proband has more than 4 phenotypic features, Diagnosis tab can be used to add more. For proband, circle on Affected tab should be activated by clicking on the relevant numbers.\n\nFor each entry on Affected and Diagnosis, an HPO term must be used. (no free text or ICD)\nIf it can not be defined by a term, or there are additional information about the term, the Note tab should be used.\nExamples\nTerm is HPO : type 1 diabetes, age of onset is not a number but a range (20s - 30s)\nPlease fill in the HPO term, then either choose an age of onset (i.e. 25), or add the range to Note as free text\nTerm is HPO: VUR, but individual is cured. \nPlease fill in the HPO term, and add the detail in the Note as free text.\n\nFor other family members, activate if any of the Affected tab applies, and if there are other phenotypic features, please use the Diagnosis tab.\n\nNotes:\nPedigree notes will be added to the family as free text info, and family member notes will be added as free text info to individuals.\n      \nAnnotations:\nWe will add each annotation to the Note of each family member (individual). One use case is the ancestry information.\n\nHandling Cases when non HPO term is used:\nIf the text is used in Affected tab, do not process, it affects the whole pedigree, Give an error\nIf the text is in \u201cCause of death, add it to notes\nIf the text is in Diagnosis tab, add it to notes\nFor example \u201cNon-HPO Phenotypic feature: Epilepsy\u201d\n\n\n#### Adding information about sample, and uploading files\nWe are currently working on tools for submitting sample metadata, and uploading files. If you have any questions please contact us at cgap.platform@gmail.com.\n",

Therefore, derivative Evidence Items that have specific fields to capture the information about the associations.  A basic item for an associations has links to the 2 Items being associated - one specified as the subject_item and the other as the object_item.  Many associations may logically fall into the subject-object relationship pattern (although the initial implementations may depend on the datasource), and once a directionality has been established ingestion of new data should follow the same convention, which may require an inversion of the relationship name. and specification of subject_item and object_item different than that used in the source.  The default relationship name is 'associated_with', which does not have a directionality of association.\n\nWhen items are linked through an Association Item then reverse links are made that allow each of the Items to know about the other.  Then the fields of the association object can be used as filters to only return the relevant associated Items in searches.\n\n**Disorder-Phenotype Associations**\n\nThese associations are made by the [HPO project](https://hpo.jax.org/) and provided in a file of [HPOA annotations](http://compbio.charite.de/jenkins/job/hpo.annotations.current/lastSuccessfulBuild/).  Currently the predominant sources of the annotations are OMIM, Orphanet and Decipher but other sources and manually curated annotations are being continuously added to the datasource.\n\nThe format of the input file is described [here](https://hpo.jax.org/app/help/annotations)\n\nThe fields of the linking item for Disorders to Phenotypes include:\n\n* The database ID for the disorder as used in the HPO annotation file - this can be helpful to identify the source of the information i.e. OMIM, Orphanet ...\n* Attribution for the source of the annotation eg. a PMID or clinician ID\n* Curation history - when and by whom the annotation was created and modified\n* A standardized evidence code for the association\n  * **IEA - inferred from electronic annotation** eg. associations parsed from the clinical features section of OMIM\n  * **PCS - published clinical study** which should have a specific publication identifier referenced in the attribution field or traceable author statement\n  * **ICE - individual clinical experience** is appropriate for disorders with limited amount of published data and should be attributed to the person or center making the annotation.\n  * **TAS - traceable author statement** is used for associations from reviews or only refers to an original publication\n* Aspect that can be one of P (Phenotypic abnormality), I (inheritance), C (onset and clinical course) or M (modifier).\n* Additional optional information that can assist in evaluating the association.\n  * a term or value with information on frequency of the association\n  * information on onset\n  * if the association is sex-specific, which sex is affected\n  * modifier - a term from the clinical modifier sub-ontology\n\n**Gene-Disorder Associations**\n\nThe source of the associations between human Genes and Disorders will be obtained from the [Monarch Initiative](https://monarchinitiative.org/).   The associations available from Monarch that were originally imported from the [OMIM](https://www.omim.org/) datasource will be used to populate the portal's Evidence items for this type of association. The source file that includes this information is `gene_disease.9606.tsv` found in this [directory](https://archive.monarchinitiative.org/latest/tsv/gene_associations/)\n",

        "body": "All file submissions to CGAP are made with\nSubmitCGAP, found [here](https://github.com/dbmi-bgm/SubmitCGAP)\nwith documentation on installation and use. \n\nSubmitCGAP will only upload files found on the\nlocal computer running the package. If your files\nare not stored locally and are instead in cloud\nstorage or a local cluster, there are a few options\nfor uploading such files. \n\n#### Load the files locally\n\nThis option works well for uploading a small number\nof files or files of small size. Files can be \ntransferred to your local computer from cloud storage\nor a computing cluster in several ways. For example,\nif your files are stored on AWS S3, tools such as \n[s3fs](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse)\nor [goofys](https://github.com/kahing/goofys) \nfacilitate mounting of S3 buckets as local file\nsystems that can be readily accessed by SubmitCGAP.\nSimilar tools exist for Google Cloud Storage and\nAzure Storage. \n\nAlternatively, the files can be directly downloaded\nfrom the remote location, for example using the \nAWS CLI for files on AWS S3. \n\nHowever, the methods above require enough free disk space\non your local computer to store the files to upload.\nAs such files can be rather large, we recommend performing\nthe upload from a cloud/cluster instance \nfor uploading many files or larger files. \n\n#### Run SubmitCGAP on remote instance\n\nFile submission can easily be scripted to accommodate\nrunning on a remote instance. Once an instance has\nbeen launched with appropriate storage requirements\nfor the files to upload, the files can either be\nmounted or downloaded as before, SubmitCGAP can be\ninstalled, and the remainder of the upload process\ncan continue as on your local computer. Note that \nyour SubmitCGAP keys (located at `~/.cgap-keys.json`)\nwill also have to be uploaded to the instance for\nsuccessful file upload to CGAP. \n\nFor example, if using an AWS EC2 instance running \nAmazon Linux 2 with\nfiles in AWS S3 and an appropriate IAM role, \nexecuting the script below (named upload_files.sh)\nwith the command:\n\n<br>\n\n```\nBUCKETS=<S3 buckets to mount> SUBMISSION_UUIDS=<Ingestion Submission UUID(s) for submitted case(s)> bash upload_files.sh\n```\n\nwill mount the indicated bucket(s) and upload the\nappropriate files to CGAP if found within the buckets.\n\n<br> \n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Install s3fs-fuse for mounting S3 buckets\nsudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y\nsudo yum install s3fs-fuse -y\n\n# Mount buckets to ~/upload_files directory\nmkdir upload_files\nfor BUCKET in $BUCKETS\ndo\n\ts3fs $BUCKET ~/upload_files/ -o iam_role\ndone\n\n# Create virtual env for package installation\npython3 -m venv ~/cgap_submission\nsource ~/cgap_submission/bin/activate\n\n# Run SubmitCGAP with mounted files\npip install submit_cgap\nfor UUID in $SUBMISSION_UUIDS\ndo\n\tresume-uploads $UUID -u ~/upload_files/ -nq -sf\ndone\n\n```\n\n\nFor further support or questions regarding file\nsubmission, please contact the CGAP team at \n[cgap@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net](mailto:cgap@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net).",

        "body": "## Submission Methods\nGene lists can be submitted directly on the CGAP\nwebsite or with command line tools. \n\nFor the web interface, click on the [\"Submit New \nGene List(s)\"](/search/?type=IngestionSubmission&currentAction=add&submissionType=GeneList)\n button on the home page once logged in. \n\nFor the command line, submission is accomplished \nwith the SubmitCGAP package, which can be found \n[here](https://github.com/dbmi-bgm/SubmitCGAP)\nalong with documentation on system requirements\nand appropriate commands. \n \n\n## File Formats\nGene lists can be uploaded as either text (.txt)\nor Excel (.xlsx) files and must match an expected \nformatting style. \n\nFor example, to create a gene list titled\n\"Cardiomyopathy\" that contains the genes MYH7 \nand MYL2, a text submission would simply include:  \n<br>\n\n```\nTitle: Cardiomyopathy  \nMYH7  \nMYL2\n```\n\nSuch a document can be found \n[here](/documents/0571667c-9b41-4877-bfc9-4c09f382be73/).\n\nA formatted Excel file that submits the same\ngene list can be downloaded \n[here](/documents/226cc533-cb85-4455-9c97-c5ee3164c143/)\n. \nSimply replace the title and genes with your own\nand save the file with a new name to create your\nExcel submission. \n\n## Gene List Contents \nThough there are multiple options for submitting a gene \nlist to CGAP, each submission \nconsists of only two items: a title and a list \nof genes.\n\n#### Title \nThe title supplied will match exactly the title of the gene \nlist as it will appear in CGAP. However, a few characters \n(&='+!?%/) are not permitted and will be automatically \nremoved if present.\n\nThe length of the gene list will be automatically added to \nthe end of the title to create the final title as viewed on \nCGAP and should not be provided; e.g. submitting a gene \nlist with 10 genes and the title *Cardiomyopathy* will \nresult in a final title of *Cardiomyopathy (10)*.\n\n**Note**: Submitting a gene list with the same title as\nan existing gene list associated with your\nproject will overwrite the contents of the existing\nitem. \n\n#### Genes\n\nThe provided genes must match genes currently in the \nCGAP database for a gene list to successfully upload.\n\nGenes can be entered in several formats, including:\n \n* Gene names/aliases\n* Ensembl IDs \n* Entrez IDs\n* OMIM IDs \n* Uniprot IDs\n\nIf a gene list fails to upload successfully because \na gene name could not be matched, we recommend \nreplacing the name with a unique identifier, such as\nan Ensembl ID. \n\n**Note**: The CGAP database does not currently include\npseudogenes so such entries will not be matched. \n\n#### Cases (optional)\n\nBy default, if no case accession is provided for\na gene list, the gene list will be applied to all\ncases in your project.\n \nIf you wish to associate a gene list with a subset\nof the cases associated with your project, you can\ninclude case accessions with your submission. To \nfind a case accession, click on a case, navigate to\nthe \"Details\" tab, and click the \"Accession\" text\nto copy the accession. \n\nFor example, a gene list submission for cases\nwith accessions GAPCAFX11111 and GAPCAFX11112\nwould look like: \n\n<br>\n\n```\nTitle: Cardiomyopathy  \nCases: GAPCAFX11111, GAPCAFX11112\nMYH7  \nMYL2\n``` \n\n## Viewing or Editing a Gene List\nOnce a gene list is successfully uploaded, it can be \nfound on CGAP at the provided link any time to inspect exactly which genes\nare included. \n\nAdditionally, the submitted document can be found as \na link under the \"Source File\" heading within the \ngene list description. \nClicking the link will bring \nyou to a page from which the submitted document can\nbe downloaded. \nThis facilitates updating of existing gene lists by\ndownloading the document, adding/removing genes as\ndesired, and then resubmitting the document. \n\n\n\n",

Below are details about filling out \neach column. \n\n**Unique Analysis ID*:** This may sometimes also be referred to \nas Case ID, but this is an ID that will be used to track \nresults of an analysis for one particular specimen. This \nneeds to be unique across all rows.\n\n**Analysis ID*:** This is an ID used to indicate which specimens\n need to be analysed together. If a trio analysis is going \nto be performed on a proband, mother, and father samples, \nthen all 3 of the corresponding rows must have the same \nanalysis ID. If the proband sample also needs to be analyzed\n on its own, or with the mother\u2019s sample only, or with an \nadditional sibling, this analysis needs a new analysis ID \nthat distinguishes it from the first trio analysis. Note \nthat in the example spreadsheet, row 2 has almost all the \nsame information as row 5, but the analysis ID and unique \nanalysis ID are different. This indicates that the proband\u2019s\n sample needs to be analysis as part of a quad analysis \n(analysis ID 1134-1) as well as alone on its own (analysis \nID 1134-2).\n\n**Family ID:** This is an ID that refers to the family being \nanalyzed. This is not required, but may be useful to track \nthe case on the CGAP portal. \n\n**Individual ID*:** This is an ID for the individual who the \nsample was collected from. Make sure this does not include \nany personal identifying information such as MRN.\n\n**Sex*:** The sex of the individual the sample was collected \nfrom. Valid options include: male, female, unknown, M, F, U.\n\n**Age:** The numerical age of the individual. Units for the age \ncan be provided in the subsequent Age Units column. Must be \nan integer.\n\n**Age Units:** Should be added whenever age is provided. The units for the age. If age isn\u2019t provided, \nthis should be left blank. Valid options include: year, \nmonth, day. Do not pluralize the units.\n\n**Birth Year:** The year the individual was born. Must be in \nformat YYYY.\n\n**Relation to Proband*:** If the individual is the \nproband/affected for the analysis, enter Proband. Otherwise,\n enter the individual\u2019s relation to the proband. Valid \noptions include: proband, mother, father, sibling. If the \nindividual is a sibling, the value can be entered as sibling\n or full sibling, and a numerical identifier can be appended\n if necessary (e.g., \u2018sibling 1\u2019 or \u2018full sibling 2\u2019 are \nalso accepted). Currently half-siblings and other relations\n aren\u2019t supported by our submission software; if you need to\n be able to submit these, please contact us directly.\n\n**Specimen Type*:** The type of specimen. Expected values \ninclude: peripheral blood, cord blood, plasma, saliva. If \nthe specimen type is none of these, a different value can \nalso be accepted.\n\n**Specimen ID*:** An ID for the specimen that was collected for\n sequencing.\n\n**Report Required*:** Whether a report needs to be generated for\n this sample in this analysis after variant interpretation \nis finalized. Commonly a report is required for the \nproband/affected only, but reports can also be generated for\n other samples in the analysis if necessary. Accepted values\n include: yes, no, Y, N.\n\n**Test Requested*:** The type of test or sequencing that was \nordered for the sample. Accepted values include: WGS, WES.\n\n**Specimen Collection Date:** The date the specimen was \ncollected from the individual. Format should be YYYY-MM-DD.\n\n**Sequencing Date:** The date the sample from the individual was\n sequenced. Format should be YYYY-MM-DD.\n\n**Files:** The raw fastq files that were produced by the \nsequencing and need to be analyzed in this analysis, \ncomma-separated. .cram files can also be accepted. For best \nresults, use the full path to the file. \n\nThe above columns constitute the metadata required for the \nCGAP portal to perform the analysis, as well as a few \nadditional columns that will show up on the Case View user \ninterface when filled out.",
