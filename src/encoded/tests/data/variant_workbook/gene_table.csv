10,gene_summary,RefSeq,2020-03-20,Gene summary,Gene summary from RefSeq,Default=CGAP KB; RefSeq if not available,,"The protein encoded by this gene is expressed in neurons of most regions of the brain. It contains an N-terminal BTB domain, which mediates dimerization of the protein, and a C-terminal Kelch domain, which mediates binding to F-actin. This protein may play a key role in the regulation of actin-based neuronal function. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2010].; The protein encoded by this gene is a ubiquitin-like protein that is conjugated to intracellular target proteins upon activation by interferon-alpha and interferon-beta. Several functions have been ascribed to the encoded protein, including chemotactic activity towards neutrophils, direction of ligated target proteins to intermediate filaments, cell-to-cell signaling, and antiviral activity during viral infections. While conjugates of this protein have been found to be noncovalently attached to intermediate filaments, this protein is sometimes secreted. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2012].; This gene encodes one of several proteins that are critical in the development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), as identified in mouse knock-out studies. The encoded protein contains several laminin G, Kazal type serine protease inhibitor, and epidermal growth factor domains. Additional post-translational modifications occur to add glycosaminoglycans and disulfide bonds. In one family with congenital myasthenic syndrome affecting limb-girdle muscles, a mutation in this gene was found. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2015].; The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily. This receptor has been shown to activate NF-kappaB through its interaction with adaptor proteins TRAF2 and TRAF5. Knockout studies in mice suggested that this receptor promotes the expression of apoptosis inhibitors BCL2 and BCL2lL1/BCL2-XL, and thus suppresses apoptosis. The knockout studies also suggested the roles of this receptor in CD4+ T cell response, as well as in T cell-dependent B cell proliferation and differentiation. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].; This gene encodes a stromal cell derived factor that is a member of the CREC protein family. The encoded protein contains six EF-hand motifs and calcium-binding motifs. This protein localizes to the Golgi lumen and may be involved in regulating calcium dependent cellular activities. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2011].; DVL1, the human homolog of the Drosophila dishevelled gene (dsh) encodes a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that regulates cell proliferation, acting as a transducer molecule for developmental processes, including segmentation and neuroblast specification. DVL1 is a candidate gene for neuroblastomatous transformation. The Schwartz-Jampel syndrome and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A have been mapped to the same region as DVL1. The phenotypes of these diseases may be consistent with defects which might be expected from aberrant expression of a DVL gene during development. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].; The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the cyclin family. Through its interaction with several proteins, such as RNA polymerase II, splicing factors, and cyclin-dependent kinases, this protein functions as a regulator of the pre-mRNA splicing process, as well as in inducing apoptosis by modulating the expression of apoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]. COMPLETENESS: complete on the 3' end.; This gene encodes a transmembrane-domain containing protein found in the brain and cerebellum. Mutations in this gene result in spinocerebellar ataxia 21. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2014].; The protein encoded by this gene is an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase that mediates ubiquitination of proteins in the Notch signaling pathway. The encoded protein may be a suppressor of melanoma invasion. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2017].; This gene encodes a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. Members of this kinase family are known to be essential for eukaryotic cell cycle control. Due to a segmental duplication, this gene shares very high sequence identity with a neighboring gene. These two genes are frequently deleted or altered in neuroblastoma. The protein kinase encoded by this gene can be cleaved by caspases and may play a role in cell apoptosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015].",N,,string,,,Y,,,,

Associates together with TP63 isoform TA*-gamma to the p21/CDKN1A promoter. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16322561, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20123734, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462}.; FUNCTION: Substrate-recognition component of some cullin-RING- based BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex. The BCR(KLHL17) mediates the ubiquitination and subsequenct degradation of GLUR6. May play a role in the actin-based neuronal function (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.; FUNCTION: Controls the stability of the leptin mRNA harboring an AU-rich element (ARE) in its 3' UTR, in cooperation with the RNA stabilizer ELAVL1 (PubMed:29180010). Decreases the stability of the leptin mRNA by antagonizing the function of ELAVL1 by inducing its atypical recruitment from the nucleus to the cytosol (By similarity). Binds to cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) and phosphatidylserine (PS) (PubMed:18191643). Promotes apoptosis by enhancing BAX-BAK hetro-oligomerization via interaction with BID in colon cancer cells (PubMed:29531808) (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8C886, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18191643, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29180010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29531808}.; FUNCTION: Regulates the expression of selective PPARGC1A/B and ESRRA/B/G target genes with roles in glucose and lipid metabolism, energy transfer, contractile function, muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity. Required for the efficient induction of MT-CO2, MT-CO3, COX4I1, TFB1M, TFB2M, POLRMT and SIRT3 by PPARGC1A. Positively regulates the PPARGC1A/ESRRG-induced expression of CKMT2, TNNI3 and SLC2A4 and negatively regulates the PPARGC1A/ESRRG-induced expression of PDK4. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q149B8}.; FUNCTION: Transcriptional repressor. Binds DNA on N-box motifs: 5'-CACNAG-3' (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.; FUNCTION: Ubiquitin-like protein which plays a key role in the innate immune response to viral infection either via its conjugation to a target protein (ISGylation) or via its action as a free or unconjugated protein. ISGylation involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions involving E1, E2, and E3 enzymes which catalyze the conjugation of ISG15 to a lysine residue in the target protein. Its target proteins include IFIT1, MX1/MxA, PPM1B, UBE2L6, UBA7, CHMP5, CHMP2A, CHMP4B and CHMP6. Can also isgylate: EIF2AK2/PKR which results in its activation, DDX58/RIG-I which inhibits its function in antiviral signaling response, EIF4E2 which enhances its cap structure-binding activity and translation- inhibition activity, UBE2N and UBE2E1 which negatively regulates their activity, IRF3 which inhibits its ubiquitination and degradation and FLNB which prevents its ability to interact with the upstream activators of the JNK cascade therby inhibiting IFNA- induced JNK signaling. Exhibits antiviral activity towards both DNA and RNA viruses, including influenza A, HIV-1 and Ebola virus. Restricts HIV-1 and ebola virus via disruption of viral budding. Inhibits the ubiquitination of HIV-1 Gag and host TSG101 and disrupts their interaction, thereby preventing assembly and release of virions from infected cells. Inhibits Ebola virus budding mediated by the VP40 protein by disrupting ubiquitin ligase activity of NEDD4 and its ability to ubiquitinate VP40. ISGylates influenza A virus NS1 protein which causes a loss of function of the protein and the inhibition of virus replication. The secreted form of ISG15 can: induce natural killer cell proliferation, act as a chemotactic factor for neutrophils and act as a IFN-gamma-inducing cytokine playing an essential role in antimycobacterial immunity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1373138, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16009940, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16112642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16428300, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16434471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16872604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18305167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19270716, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19357168, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2005397, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20133869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20308324, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20639253, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21543490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22693631, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22859821, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23229543, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7526157, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8550581}.; FUNCTION: Isoform 1: heparan sulfate basal lamina glycoprotein that plays a central role in the formation and the maintenance of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and directs key events in postsynaptic differentiation. Component of the AGRN-LRP4 receptor complex that induces the phosphorylation and activation of MUSK. The activation of MUSK in myotubes induces the formation of NMJ by regulating different processes including the transcription of specific genes and the clustering of AChR in the postsynaptic membrane. Calcium ions are required for maximal AChR clustering. AGRN function in neurons is highly regulated by alternative splicing, glycan binding and proteolytic processing. Modulates calcium ion homeostasis in neurons, specifically by inducing an increase in cytoplasmic calcium ions. Functions differentially in the central nervous system (CNS) by inhibiting the alpha(3)- subtype of Na+/K+-ATPase and evoking depolarization at CNS synapses. This secreted isoform forms a bridge, after release from motor neurons, to basal lamina through binding laminin via the NtA domain.; FUNCTION: Isoform 1, isoform 4 and isoform 5: neuron-specific (z+) isoforms that contain C-terminal insertions of 8-19 AA are potent activators of AChR clustering. Isoform 5, agrin (z+8), containing the 8-AA insert, forms a receptor complex in myotubules containing the neuronal AGRN, the muscle-specific kinase MUSK and LRP4, a member of the LDL receptor family. The splicing factors, NOVA1 and NOVA2, regulate AGRN splicing and production of the 'z' isoforms.; FUNCTION: Agrin N-terminal 110 kDa subunit: is involved in regulation of neurite outgrowth probably due to the presence of the glycosaminoglcan (GAG) side chains of heparan and chondroitin sulfate attached to the Ser/Thr- and Gly/Ser-rich regions. Also involved in modulation of growth factor signaling (By similarity). {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19631309, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21969364}.; FUNCTION: Inactive polyglycylase. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19524510}.",Y,,,,,N,,,,
