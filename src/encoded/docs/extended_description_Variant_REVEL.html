    REVEL is a combination score based on 13 individual scores for predicting pathogenicity:
    MutPred, FATHMM v2.3, VEST 3.0, PolyPhen2, SIFT, PROVEAN, MutationAssessor, MutationTaster,
    LRT, GERP++, SiPhy, phyloP, and phastCons. Applicable to missense variants only.
    Scores range from 0-1, and closer to 1 indicates a higher prediction of pathogenicity.
    The rankscore is a value between 0-1 indicating where this variant's score falls
    relative to all other variants with REVEL scores. For more information see the
