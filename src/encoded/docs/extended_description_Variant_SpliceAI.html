    SpliceAI predicts whether a variant causes a splice acceptor gain or loss, or
    a splice donor gain or loss. The score shown here is the max score of these four
    scores. Scores range between 0-1 and closer to 1 indicates higher likelihood of
    the variant disrupting normal splicing in the gene. For more information see the
