<h5>
    The hg19 coordinates for structural variants are calculated.
</h5>

<p>
All variants are currently called for the hg38 reference genome. If the variant in hg19
coordinates is not available, the conversion calculation was not successful.
</p>

<p>
For structural variants, both the start and end coordinates are converted to hg19 via an
implementation of <a href="https://github.com/konstantint/pyliftover">LiftOver</a>. If
either one of these conversions fails, the variant will not be available in hg19
coordinates.
