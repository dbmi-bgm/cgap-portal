    PolyPhen2 predicts whether an amino acid substitution is tolerated or deleterious
    based on sequence and structure predictive features. Applicable to missense variants
    only. Scores range from 0-1, with scores closer to 0 indicating a benign prediction
    and scores closer to 1 indicating a deleterious prediction. Predictions can be one of
    "D" for probably damaging, "P" for possibly damaging, or "B" for benign. The
    rankscore is a value between 0-1 indicating where this variant's score falls
    compared to all other variants with PolyPhen2 scores. For more information see
