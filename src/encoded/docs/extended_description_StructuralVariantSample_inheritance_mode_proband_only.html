<h5>Inheritance mode values are candidate labels based on genotype assignments.</h5>

<p>This case is labeled as proband-only. Since no other family members are in the
 analysis, most of the traditional inheritance modes can not be assigned.
<b>Inheritance modes that can NOT be assigned on this case include:</b></p>
<ul><li> de novo calls
<li> Dominant (Maternal) vs Dominant (Paternal) vs Recessive
<li> Loss of Heterozygosity
</ul>

<p>Variants on the X or Y chromosome are still classified <b>X-linked</b> or
 <b>Y-linked</b>, even though they can't be called as dominant, recessive, or de novo.
</p>

<p><b>Low relevance</b>: </p>
<ul>
<li> Variants with missing calls (./.) or calls that mismatch the sex (0/1 on chrX for
     a male) are not assigned inheritance mode values.
<li> Variants with genotypes that do not meet any of the high relevant criteria above
     are not assigned inheritance mode labels.
