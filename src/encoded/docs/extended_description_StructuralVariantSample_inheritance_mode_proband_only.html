<h5>
Inheritance mode values are candidate labels based on genotype assignments.
</h5>

<p>
This case is labeled as proband-only. Since no other family members are in the analysis, most of the traditional inheritance modes can not be assigned.
</p>

<p>
<b>Inheritance modes that can not be assigned on this case include:</b>
<ul>
<li> de novo calls
<li> Dominant (Maternal) vs Dominant (Paternal) vs Recessive
<li> Loss of Heterozygosity
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Variants on the X or Y chromosome are classified <b>X-linked</b> or <b>Y-linked</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Low relevance</b>:
<ul>
<li> Variants with missing calls (./.) or calls that mismatch the sex (e.g. 0/1 on chrX for a male) are not assigned inheritance mode values.
<li> Variants with genotypes that do not meet any of the high relevance criteria above are not assigned inheritance mode labels.
