<h5> Consequence values come directly from Ensembl VEP and correspond to the predicted
     effects of the variant on a transcript. </h5>

<p> Multiple consequences can apply for any given transcript. For example, a
 protein-coding transcript that is partially truncated towards its 5' end by a deletion
 may have the the following consequences: Start lost, Coding sequence variant, and 5
 prime UTR variant. </p>

<p> Of note, two consequences, namely <b> Transcript ablation </b> and <b> Transcript 
 amplification </b>, imply an entire transcript is contained within the variant. These
 consequences have the caveat that they are never accompanied by other consequences.
 Thus, when filtering for variants affecting coding sequences, these consequences should
 always be included with the Coding sequence variant consequence. </p>

<p> When searching for SVs causing loss of function, consider utilizing the following
 combination of consequences:
<ul>
<li> Trancript ablation
<li> Stop gained
<li> Frameshift variant
<li> Start lost
</ul>
</p>

<p> For triplosensitive genes, the Transcript amplification consequence may be
 particularly relevant. </p>
