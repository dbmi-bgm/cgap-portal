    SIFT score predicts whether an amino acid substitution will affect protein function.&nbsp;
    Applicable to missense variants only. Scores range from 0-1, and a score of&nbsp;
    &lt;0.05 indicates intolerance or deleteriousness. SIFT predictions are either&nbsp;
    "D" for damaging or "T" for tolerated. The rankscore is a value between 0-1&nbsp;
    indicating where the SIFT score falls compared to all other variants with SIFT&nbsp;
    scores. For more information see the <a href="https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/">SIFT site</a>&nbsp;
