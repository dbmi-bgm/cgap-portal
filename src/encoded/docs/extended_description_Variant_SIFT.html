    SIFT score predicts whether an amino acid substitution will affect protein function.
    Applicable to missense variants only. Scores range from 0-1, and a score of
    &lt;0.05 indicates intolerance or deleteriousness. SIFT predictions are either
    "D" for damaging or "T" for tolerated. The rankscore is a value between 0-1
    indicating where the SIFT score falls compared to all other variants with SIFT
    scores. For more information see the <a href="https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/">SIFT site</a>
