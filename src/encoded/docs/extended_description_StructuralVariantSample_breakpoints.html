<h5>
    Breakpoint locations are determined relative to the transcript based on VEP
    annotations.
</h5>

<p>
Most transcripts have sufficient annotation information to calculate where the
structural variant starts and ends relative to the 5 prime and 3 prime ends of the
transcript. Possible values include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b> Upstream </b>: Breakpoint is located beyond the 5 prime UTR.
    <li>
        <b> Downstream </b>: Breakpoint is located beyond the 3 prime UTR.
    <li>
        <b> 5 prime UTR </b>: Breakpoint is located within the 5 prime UTR.
    <li>
        <b> 3 prime UTR </b>: Breakpoint is located within the 3 prime UTR.
    <li>
        <b> Upstream or 5 prime UTR </b>: Breakpoint is located either upstream of or
        within the 5 prime UTR (insufficient information to determine which).
    <li>
        <b> 3 prime UTR or Downstream </b>: Breakpoint is located either in the 3 prime
        UTR or downstream of it (insufficient information to determine which).
    <li>
        <b> Exonic </b>: Breakpoint is located within an exon.
    <li>
        <b> Intronic </b>: Breakpoint is located within an intron.
    <li>
        <b> Within miRNA </b>: Breakpoint is located within an miRNA coding region.
    <li>
        <b> Indeterminate </b>: Insufficient information to determine a location for the
        breakpoint relative to the transcript.
