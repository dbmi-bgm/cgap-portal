    phastCons conservation score based on multiple sequence alignment across 100
    vertebrates. In contrast to phyloP, it takes into account not just this particular
    site in the alignment but also flanking sites to determine if a site belongs
    to a conserved region. The scores range from 0 to 1 and closer to 1 indicates
    greater conservation. More information available in the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gr.3715005">publication</a>.
