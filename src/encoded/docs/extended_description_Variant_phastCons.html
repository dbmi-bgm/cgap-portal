    phastCons conservation score based on multiple sequence alignment across 100&nbsp;
    vertebrates. In contrast to phyloP, it takes into account not just this particular&nbsp;
    site in the alignment but also flanking sites to determine if a site belongs&nbsp;
    to a conserved region. The scores range from 0 to 1 and closer to 1 indicates&nbsp;
    greater conservation. More information available in the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gr.3715005">publication</a>.
