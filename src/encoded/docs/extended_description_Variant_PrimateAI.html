    PrimateAI predicts pathogenicity for missense variants based on comparison to&nbsp;
    primate sequences and variants using a deep learning approach. Scores range&nbsp;
    from 0-1 with scores above 0.803 indicating a pathogenic prediction. Predictions&nbsp;
    can be one of "D" for damaging (&gt;0.803) or "T" for tolerated (&lt;0.803).&nbsp;
    The rankscore is a value between 0-1 indicating where this variant's score falls&nbsp;
    compared to all other variants with PrimateAI scores. For details see the&nbsp;
