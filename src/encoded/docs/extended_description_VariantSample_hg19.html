<h5>
    The HGVS-formatted variant in hg19 coordinates is calculated.
</h5>

<p>
All variants are currently called for the hg38 reference genome. If the variant in hg19
coordinates is not available, the conversion calculation was not successful.
</p>

<p>
To calculate the variant for hg19 coordinates, the hg38 position is converted to hg19
via an implementation of 
<a href="https://github.com/konstantint/pyliftover">LiftOver</a>. If the hg19 conversion
is successful, the variant is then converted to HGSV format. If the HGSV conversion is
also successful, the result will be displayed. Otherwise, only the hg38 coordinates for
the variant will be displayed.
