# The `testdata` directory

This directory is for arbitrary JSON/JS data that usually consists of a `context` or JSON representation of some view.
The idea is that test data within this directory may be imported into and used in (a) JS unit tests or (b) as test data in the course of developing front-end components when creating or exporting test inserts would be too tedious or impractical (e.g. too much data to load in local machine).
