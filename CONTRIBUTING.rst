Open Source & Community Building: Work In Progress
--------------------------------------------------

Background
==========

The CGAP ecosystem is composed of a number of repositories that have been developed
over a number of years. With a few small exceptions, most of our source code is
available in our GitHub repositories with an open source license of some kind.
However, we're very conscious of the fact that there's more to open source than
just dumping text into an open source repository.

The first step in that is making it possible at all to make more than one CGAP.
Originally, that was not possible, but we've spent more than a year prototyping
and testing the technology needed to create high quality, secure, deployments
in a relatively automatic way. Some configuration and tuning is still needed, but
we're making definite progress, and testing that with a small number of hospital
systems.

The next step going forward is to make all of that possible to do in a self-serve way.


How To Contribute
=================

When it was just our own little project, we didn't have much of a way for outsiders to
contribute, although we did certainly take advantage of open source code that others wrote.

At this point, we're partnering with hospitals who want to help us find the issues
in our processes for deploying and maintaining our software, and for collaborating with
us on bug fixes and new features.  That's still a very custom process and not something
for which we have specific guidelines.

But, coming up soon, as we start to move toward a self-serve model, we'll be wanting to
create a better way to engage the community.  We're working out the details for that now.
Watch `our "Get Involved" page <https://cgap.hms.harvard.edu/getinvolved>`_ for details.

If you have suggestions, send us email at

Code of Conduct
===============

At present, our collaborations have been mostly within our own organization or our close partners,
and our normal institutional rules suffice. As we open to the public, we'll need a good set of
community guidelines to make sure everyone is kind and supportive of one another.  If you have
suggestions for what works well or doesn't, let us know by sending email at
`cgap-support@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net <mailto:cgap-support@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net>`_.
