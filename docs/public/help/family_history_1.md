After accessioning data is submitted for one or more cases,
a family history in .xlsx format can be uploaded either
[here](/search/?type=IngestionSubmission&currentAction=add&submissionType=Family%20History),
 or via the SubmitCGAP command line tool. Example files are
linked below, and the subsequent section contains details
about the spreadsheet format and each individual column. The
last 2 sections describe how to upload the file.

**Note**: For most analyses, we recommend [submitting accessioning information](/help/submission/accessioning)
before the family history. However, if you are submitting a case that involves
samples from extended family members beyond parents and siblings, please submit
the family history first.
