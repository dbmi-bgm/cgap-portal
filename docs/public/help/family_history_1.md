After accessioning data is submitted for one or more cases,
a family history in .xlsx format can be uploaded either
[here](/search/?type=IngestionSubmission&currentAction=add&submissionType=Family%20History),
 or via the SubmitCGAP command line tool. Example files are
linked below, and the subsequent section contains details
about the spreadsheet format and each individual column. The
next section describes how to upload the file, and the final
section includes tutorial videos for family history spreadsheet 
formatting and submission.

**Note**: For most analyses, we recommend [submitting accessioning information](/help/submission/accessioning)
before the family history. However, if you are submitting a case that involves
samples from extended family members beyond parents and siblings, please submit
the family history first.
