Authenticated Access to CGAP
============================


Requesting An Account
---------------------

To **request a new account** or if you have **trouble**
 **logging in**, please contact us for support at
 [cgap-support@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net](mailto:cgap-support@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net).

CGAP Login Workflow
-------------------

CGAP uses the Auth0 authentication solution, which interfaces with
 a variety of different identity providers (IdP) to support institutional
 login to the CGAP portal.

A CGAP admin creates a user account for users with their institutional
 email address. When logging into the CGAP portal using the institutional
 email, Auth0 will callback to the IdP of the supported institution to
 authenticate the user. The email will be rejected if the institutional
 login is not supported by our Auth0 application. We add new institutions
 on a case-by-case basis as needed by our users. It is preferred that
 standard (non-internal) users stick with authentication through their
 respective institutions rather than through an
 associated Google Account.

As of writing, we support the below institutional logins. If your institution
 is not supported, and you are a current or planned user, please contact us so that we
 can provide support for the new institution. CGAP plans to support all IdPs that
 our authentication solution (Auth0) supports.

* Google - note that all emails can create an associated Google Account
   and gain access to the CGAP portal. This is recommended for internal
   users only but in practice is frequently used due to
   institutions not offering IT support necessary to
   configure SAML connections.

* HarvardKey - `hms.harvard.edu` emails will be redirected to HarvardKey
 on login.

* Partners - `partners.org` emails will be redirected to Partners login.


Once authenticated through Auth0, the authenticated email address is checked
 against our metadata database. If a user with that email exists
 in our database, that user is considered "logged in", and a session token (JWT)
 is created.


Creating the Google Account
---------------------------

Users who cannot use Partners or HarvardKey to login will need an
 associated Google Account with the institutional email
 they will be authenticating to the CGAP Portal with.

If you do not already have a Google Account associated with your
 institutional email address, you can set up one up by visiting
 the [Google account creation page with the non-gmail option](https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail).

Note that it is important not to register this account to have gmail
 as your institutional email address must be the primary email
 associated with the Google Account for authentication to work properly!

Once your account request is processed, you will then be able to log
 in with the 'LOG IN WITH GOOGLE' option using your institutional
 email address and Google account password.

How to Log in
-------------

To log in, click on the icon in the upper
 right that says "Log In". A login window will pop up that will have
 two options:

* Use "Sign In with Google" if your institutional login is associated
   with a Google account and you would like to authenticate through Google.
   Note that internal users who have created Google Accounts for their
   `hms.harvard.edu` emails can choose to login via either pathway.

* If your account is associated with a `harvard.edu`, `partners.org`, or BCH email
   account, and you do not have an associated Google Account, you must login by
   entering the institutional email associated with your CGAP user into the login box.
   After filling this and clicking "Log In", you will then see another pop-up
   that prompts you to sign in with your respective IdP.
