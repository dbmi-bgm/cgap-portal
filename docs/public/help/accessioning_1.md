Submission of accessioning information or metadata about
patient samples to be analyzed will be done via spreadsheet
(.xlsx format). A link to our accessioning templates are provided below. 
The next section of this page will explain
how to fill out the spreadsheet. The third section will go
over how to submit the spreadsheet once it is complete. The final
section includes tutorial videos for spreadsheet formatting
and submission.

**Note**: For most analyses, we recommend submitting accessioning information
before the family history. However, if you are submitting a case that involves
samples from extended family members beyond parents and siblings, please
[submit the family history](/help/submission/family-history) first.
