Submission of accessioning information or metadata about
patient samples to be analyzed will be done via spreadsheet
(.xlsx format). A link to our accessioning template is
provided below. The next section of this page will explain
how to fill out the spreadsheet. The final section will go
over how to submit the spreadsheet once it is complete.

**Note**: For most analyses, we recommend submitting accessioning information
before the family history. However, if you are submitting a case that involves
samples from extended family members beyond parents and siblings, please
[submit the family history](/help/submission/family-history) first.
