There are two main options currently available for submission.

<br/>

<ol>
    <li>Submit via Web UI</li>
    <li>Submit to CGAP yourself using a python package that
 can be invoked via a command line interface.</li>
</ol>

<br/>

<h4>Option 1: Web UI submission</h4>

Go to the CGAP home page and make sure you are logged in.
Then click on <a href="/search/?type=IngestionSubmission&currentAction=add&submissionType=Family+History">"Submit Family History"</a>. 
If you are associated with more than one project or 
institution, select the one the relevant case(s) are
 associated with from the dropdown menus, and upload the
 excel file. The server will then process the file and
 extract metadata to prepare the pedigree on CGAP, but
 you may need to wait ~30 seconds for this process to finish.
 If there are any errors in the formatting of the excel file,
 the server will report this back to you so that you can
 edit the file and resubmit. Upon successful submission, you
 will be directed to view the relevant case(s), in which you
 will now be able to see an interactive pedigree.

<h4>Option 2: Submission with the python package</h4>

We have developed a python package for submission of
 various types of data to the CGAP portal, called
 SubmitCGAP. The current version is still in beta. It can be
 installed by running `pip install submit-cgap`. We
 recommend doing this inside a virtual environment running
 python 3.7. Further instructions for submission with this
 method can be found in the <a href="https://submitcgap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#family-history">SubmitCGAP documentation</a>.

<br/><br/>

Briefly, the command is the same as for new case/accessioning CLI submission, but
 with the added <code>-t</code> or <code>--ingestion_type</code> option:

<pre><code>

submit-metadata-bundle &lt;pedigree.xlsx&gt; -s &lt;CGAP_server_url&gt; -t family_history -v

</pre></code>

As with submitting cases, the <code>-v</code> flag runs a validate-only dry run to check formatting of the spreadsheet.
 When that passes, the command can be run without that option:

<pre><code>

submit-metadata-bundle &lt;pedigree.xlsx&gt; -s &lt;CGAP_server_url&gt; -t family_history

</pre></code>
