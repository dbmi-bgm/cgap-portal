<h2> Submission Methods </h2>
Gene lists can be submitted directly on the CGAP
website or with command line tools.

<br/> <br/>

For the web interface, click on the <a href="/search/?type=IngestionSubmission&currentAction=add&submissionType=Gene%20List">"Submit New 
Gene List(s)"</a>
 button on the home page once logged in. 

 <br/> <br/>

For the command line, submission is accomplished 
with the SubmitCGAP package, which can be found 
<a href="https://github.com/dbmi-bgm/SubmitCGAP">here</a>
along with documentation on system requirements
and appropriate commands. 

<br/> <br/>

All tutorial videos can be found on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cgaptraining">CGAP Training Youtube channel</a>.

<br/>

<h2> File Formats </h2>
Gene lists can be uploaded as either text (.txt)
or Excel (.xlsx) files and must match an expected 
formatting style. 

<br/> <br/>

For example, to create a gene list titled
"Cardiomyopathy" that contains the genes MYH7 
and MYL2, a text submission would simply include:  
<br>

<pre><code>
Title: Cardiomyopathy  
MYH7  
MYL2
</pre></code>

A formatted Excel file that submits the same
gene list can be downloaded 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbmi-bgm/cgap-portal/master/docs/public/help/help_linked_docs/genelist_template.xlsx">here</a>. 
Simply replace the title and genes with your own
and save the file with a new name to create your
Excel submission. 

<br/>

<h2> Gene List Contents </h2>
Though there are multiple options for submitting a gene 
list to CGAP, each submission 
consists of only two items: a title and a list 
of genes.

<br/> 

<h4> Title </h4>
The title supplied will match exactly the title of the gene 
list as it will appear in CGAP. However, a few characters 
(&amp;='+!?%/) are not permitted and will be automatically 
removed if present.

<br/> <br/>

The length of the gene list will be automatically added to 
the end of the title to create the final title as viewed on 
CGAP and should not be provided; e.g. submitting a gene 
list with 10 genes and the title <i>Cardiomyopathy</i> will 
result in a final title of <i>Cardiomyopathy (10)</i>.

<br/> <br/>

<strong>Note</strong>: Submitting a gene list with the same title as
an existing gene list associated with your
project will overwrite the contents of the existing
item. 

<br/>

<h4> Genes </h4>
The provided genes must match genes currently in the 
CGAP database for a gene list to successfully upload.

<br/> <br/>

Genes can be entered in several formats, including:
 
<ul>
    <li>Gene names/aliases</li>
    <li>Ensembl IDs </li>
    <li>Entrez IDs</li>
    <li>OMIM IDs </li>
    <li>Uniprot IDs</li>
</ul>

<br/>

If a gene list fails to upload successfully because 
a gene name could not be matched, we recommend 
replacing the name with a unique identifier, such as
an Ensembl ID. 

<br/> <br/>

<strong>Note</strong>: The CGAP database does not currently include
pseudogenes so such entries will not be matched. 

<br/>

<h4> Cases (optional) </h4>

By default, if no case accession is provided for
a gene list, the gene list will be applied to all
cases in your project.
 
<br/> <br/>

If you wish to associate a gene list with a subset
of the cases associated with your project, you can
include case accessions with your submission. To 
find a case accession, click on a case, navigate to
the "Details" tab, and click the "Accession" text
to copy the accession. 

<br/> <br/>

For example, a gene list submission for cases
with accessions GAPCAFX11111 and GAPCAFX11112
would look like: 

<br/>

<pre><code>
Title: Cardiomyopathy  
Cases: GAPCAFX11111, GAPCAFX11112
MYH7  
MYL2
</pre></code>

<h2> Viewing or Editing a Gene List </h2>
Once a gene list is successfully uploaded, it can be 
found on CGAP at the provided link any time to inspect exactly which genes
are included. 

<br/> <br/>

Additionally, the submitted document can be found as 
a link under the "Source File" heading within the 
gene list description. 
Clicking the link will bring 
you to a page from which the submitted document can
be downloaded. 
This facilitates updating of existing gene lists by
downloading the document, adding/removing genes as
desired, and then resubmitting the document.
